"""Which room the robot is in, from where it is (4.4.0).

THE ROOM FROM THE POSITION, WHERE THERE IS ONE (@frnchfrgg). Room
tracking moves through the planned rooms on phase changes and drives,
and decides whether a room is done from how long the robot has been in
it against an estimate. A robot that cleans in another order, or a run
whose rooms took longer or shorter than estimated, gives room changes
that never happened.

A robot that reports its position, or answers when asked for it, says
where it is. Where that position can be placed in a room -- a Smart Map
whose rooms the aligner has placed, or a 900-series whose floor Roomba+
has divided into areas -- the room comes from there instead:

  * A room counts once the robot has stayed in it for DWELL_SEC, with
    at least MIN_SAMPLES positions. A robot crossing a doorway, or
    passing through a hall, does not change the room.
  * A position outside every room (a doorway, floor the map does not
    cover) changes nothing.
  * Positions that stop for STALE_SEC hand room tracking back to the
    phase changes and estimates (callbacks.py).

This module only decides. callbacks._apply_position_room() moves the
room display and fires the room events.
