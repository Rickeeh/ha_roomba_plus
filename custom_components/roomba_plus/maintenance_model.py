"""The maintenance model: one entry per part and per care task (4.5.0).

ONE CALCULATION, MANY READERS. Until 4.5.0 every surface worked out
maintenance for itself -- the remaining-hours sensors, the due sensor,
the to-do list, the household API -- from the same store but not the
same rules, so a 980 on its series profile showed one interval and was
due at another, and a reset button left an i3+ due until the next
restart. This module builds the entries once; the status sensor, the
part sensors' attributes, the event entity, the actions and the REST
view read them.

AN ENTRY, for Classic and Prime alike (`MaintenanceItem`):

    id              stable: "replace.filter", "clean.wheel",
                    "replace.part_202"
    action          "replace" or "clean"
    part            the role: filter, main_brush, wheel, bag, ...
    level           ok, soon, due, overdue
    used            share of the interval used, 0 ... 1+
    remaining/unit  what is left, in the counter's unit
    due             when it is (or was) due, where that can be said
    interval/...    the interval, its unit and where it comes from
    last_done       when it was last replaced or cleaned
    done            what "done" writes: local, cloud, both

THE LEVELS. Replacing: soon from 80 % of the interval (an option: 80,
60 or never), due at 100 %, overdue seven days after it was first seen
due. Cleaning: due on its date, overdue after half an interval more --
a weekly filter after three and a half days. Cleaning has no "soon": at
intervals of three to thirty days it would be noise.

THE TRACKER (`MaintenanceTracker`) keeps the entries current and is the
only part that touches Home Assistant: it recomputes on a timer and
whenever counters or resets change, remembers per entry when it became
due and what was last announced, and sends one event per level change
-- not one per restart. It also carries out "done" and "snooze".

Plain functions above the tracker, no entity imports: the API views
read this module, and the package root imports those.
